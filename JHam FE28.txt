The best way I found to avoid the headache is join a good league. It's more like real racing anyhow. You race the same guys every week. You know who to trust and who to stay away from. You know who to race hard and who to occasionally put in the wall. You have good moderators who keep racers in line or they get booted from the race or the league.

NASCAR xFinity Chevy Camaro, Ford Mustang & Toyota Supra » Axle/Truck arm assembly preload does ?? » Go to message	10/23/2012 3:27 p.m.
Mark A Carpenter wrote:
I don't know if this will help anyone else still struggling, but this is why a front ARB increases understeer, while a rear ARB (and the TA assembly) increases oversteer. The front ARB increases wedge by loading up the RF and LR. A rear ARB decreases wedge by loading up the LF and RR.

If you preload a bar, or the TA assembly, with negative preload, you are twisting the chassis in the opposite direction that the chassis will roll in a left hand turn. This basically engages the bar early, so that it is already working the way it would in the corner even while the car is sitting still, as that's the bars' job, to resist roll and push the chassis back in the opposite direction of roll.

If you put positive load in the bar or TAA, you are rolling the chassis in the *same* direction as roll in a turn. I haven't seen a good reason for doing this yet. There may be one, but I'm just not aware of it. (I'd love to be enlightened if there is.) The whole idea of an ARB is to resist roll. Once that positive preload is matched by the forces in the turn, the bar then starts to resist roll, the way it normally does.

Think of preload as a person standing on either side of the car, pushing on the roof rail and trying to roll the car, but they can't move once they get set. If they are on the right side (negative preload), there is already resistance to roll. Any pushing they do is just a head start to what the bar normally does. If the person is on the left side (positive preload), they are trying to roll the car to the right. As the car enters the turn, that little bit of roll that the person is adding will be gone once the car reaches the point in the turn where it would normally lean that much. Then the car pulls away from the person (as they can't move), and at this point, the bar then starts to resist roll.



there is a reason for inducing roll by adding positive load on the front ARB, you can reduce slop in the rolling by inducing the roll with positive load on the front arb.... this works very well with a small dia bar. basically it enduces roll, and makes you looser on entry, but takes the slop out of the middle and exit because you're inducing roll sooner, therefore reaching the limit sooner. you can use it as a way to control body roll.

There are probably 5 different ways, maybe more to achieve this result... are you using paths and then applying a brush stroke to it, or using illustrator to create the paths first, import them and then brush them?

Looks like you are using noise or some other filter to create the metallic?

i've shared this in every practice and quite a few people are running. Good luck

i just don't see the wrecking scenario, that is what protesting is for anyways.
Feature Suggestions »  irating for each class » Go to message	9/11/2011 9:10 a.m.
it is simply disadvantageous to earn irating than throw it away by starting a new car in the same track type (oval or road) so people stick to what they know, the series becomes static and the cream rises to the top. If each series was treated as it's own, we'd race more series.... there would be a wider range of talent and more users in each series... its very simple.

case in point, moving from silverado to impala b cot at the SAME TRACK.
last week was silverado's at chicago land, gained irating, this week is impala b cot at chicagoland

i do a lot of testing, a lot practice, share setups ask people to test my stuff visa-versa and it's rewarded me with a loss of over 400 irating points at the same track where i raced the silverado and gained irating.

right now, my silverado irating could be 2100 or more, but instead it was just 17xx after 4 or 5 races of being "involved" with the b car... frankly that is why people don't do what i'm trying to do.

If irating was different for each class, then I would buy class b and class a content for road.

as it is, I simply do not race other road cars as I do not want to affect my V8SC iRating...

what I mean by this, is I do not want any other class/car changing my iRating whether it be up or down I am happy to know my iRating reflects V8SC only and to do that I have to ignore any other road series... I dont like this...

very telling that quote is.

and how do you know that the driver behind was laying back? how do you know it wasn't the guys in front accelerating earlier than expected?

Protest it or shut up and deal with it.

thats pretty rude......

it's a computer simulation, it can do math beyond comprehension and there is no logical reason provided on this post so far describing why the servers couldn't figure that out.

every scenario can be accounted for, it's mathematical. to your specific comment, you build in a buffer on the program knowing that x car can accelerate at x speed and for every x feet is goes you can account for how far back the last car in line should be. if you are x far back you're too far back to be an issue based on speed and distance...

if laying back isn't illegal then why would we protest it? complaining by protest regarding a rule that isn't being broken is more pointless than making a legitimate suggestion in the "suggestions" forum don't you think?

Andrew,

1) Separate iRaitng do not means separate Safety Ratings.


if irating is all about putting you in splits with people of like talent, why on earth would (you.... iracing) put somebody with a 2000 irating in silverado's with 2000 irating A impala's, it's illogical. couldn't you just determine the amount races completed or race laps completed in a given vehicle and instead of lumping them all together?

might as well take my ever plummeting irating with me to road course and tank it there. i don't get it and nobody has really given a good reason for it to stay the way it is... other than available resources/ie labor.

if it is so good the way it is, why don't they just make 1 irating for road courses and oval? i mean whats the big deal at this point. they obviously realize there is a need to separate by series type, but why did you stop there iracing? illogical.

Feature Suggestions » penalize laying back » Go to message	9/3/2011 9:19 p.m.
laying back, and then getting a huge run is a major loop hole and i wish iracing would penalize us for doing it

if the spotter can determine we are far enough back to say "catch the x car" its smart enough to penalize us if we don't.

black flag us
even better let us do it and if we get a 0-4x in the process we get ejected from the race, and put in last place.

you can't fix stupid, but you can penalize us for it.

tank slapping has a lot to do with camber, you snap loose because of how the tire contact patch and the sidewalls are working to keep grip, camber plays a much bigger role than people give it credit for.

what ryan said is a good idea, similar to what i was thinking. i'm just asking not to take a big punch in my irating in the c series when i go and race in the a car... i mean why should i lose all my "experience" and "acquired skill" (isn't that what irating is???) by jumping into an a car.... i'm fine with starting from scratch in the b or a car.... if you can drive you can get through the lower splits and it can be fun and safe and teach people stuff but not if i'm' going to hand them huge irating if i do get punted and then trash my c series hard work...

it discourages trying other series honestly.

good form.

bump because it's not fair to get punished in one series for sucking in another.... this doesn't happen in real racing, you won't lose points in one series because of what you do in another, so if this simulation is so close to real world why don't that fix the point system to at least separate the series.

well that is going to happen you have a computer involved... you can never fix it.... somebody will spend months finding the glitches and loop holes then they win... alot.



+1
iracing is a racket for the people getting setups built for them by teams and essentially beating the simulation, the way to fix that is to change the conditions and randomly change the tire model just like nascar does.

another suggestion, have irating for each class and pick a class for your irating to count in and only 1, just like nascar.

it's unrealistic to change the conditions in a race because that requires a random modifier to simulate rubber buildup or a cooler track, etc. but at least they could start with affecting the conditions daily.
NASCAR Gander Outdoors - Chevrolet Silverado, Toyota Tundra & Ford F150 » suggestion? » Go to message	5/15/2011 9:36 p.m.
i hope the new tire model fixes the built in or "programmed" line. something is inherently wrong about 1 line always being the fastest, the big issue i see is that no saved setup should feel the same every single time you run at the track. put in a new variable everyday that changes the track somehow.

i wish they'd focus on making what they have better instead of trying be like autodesk and microsoft where they do a little of everything but nothing superb....

it appears to be going down the get every track for every series and every car instead of building the highest quality single series.

this is super fun, just making some observations.

i watched your replay, and i can see that its doing what i want it to do by being very dog tracked. I don't like tight setups because they chew up tires over the long fuel run. I'm trying to make a setup that doesn't chew up tires and will last an entire fuel run and i think this is closer.

I think the small sway bar is causing the instability would you agree? thanks again. I like the roll over because as you can see in the replay it really sets the truck up for the middle of the corner and helps with coming off, versus the tight setups which are great for short runs but suffer major fall over the long run.
