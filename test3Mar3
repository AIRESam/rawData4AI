I've not been watching the LFE developments super-close, so I'm not sure, but that does sound like an interesting experiment. Mind you, I am not surprised iRacing are super-sensitive about the potential for exploits with prize money at stake in the top competitions.

Yeah, 360 Hz telemetry is a little fiddly. As I understand it, the SDK dumps arrays of 6 elements at 60 Hz. I didn't get around to experimenting with 360 Hz yet, in fact my multi-sim telemetry project stalled in rF2 testing - been too busy in RL the past year or more. Hopefully I will get more space next year to resume the project.

I am impressed with the improved feel of the iRacing tyres since the 2021S4 release for the cars I drive (Lotus 49 and Formula Vee) - something significant changed. I also changed to a more realistic FOV in October and have been astonished by the difference it has made to my driving consistency and ability to drive near the limit and recover the car when I step over. So, for the moment, I am mainly enjoying actually driving the cars! Recently, I have spent most of my time in the Formula Vee Time Attack competition.

The more race vehicle dynamics I study, the more I realise I do not know! A very deep rabbithole indeed, but also a very enjoyable hobby. Though it has not been widely publicised, I am also very pleased to see that Terence Groening has joined the iRacing crew. Here is a recent interview:
